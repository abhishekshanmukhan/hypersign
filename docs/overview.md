# [Hypersign](http://hypermine.in/hypersign/)

**Hypersign** is a cryptography based SingleSignOn Solution that enables users to securely access applications (web apps as well as DApps) without providing their access credentials [usernames and passwords].

**Components**

 - HS-Mobile App
 - HS-Auth Server
 - HS-SDK
 - HS-SSO

[Here](hs-products.md) is the list of product line.

The protocol further enables a user to securely sign transactions in decentralized environments; the **HS-SDK** allows easy authentication to the Blockchain.  Hypersign uses cryptographic algorithms and equations in the mobile application, totally eliminating the need for usernames and passwords. The Application Server (**HS-Auth Service**) does not store user data, rather it relies on the users private key and public key [generated using the ECDSA - Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm] stored in users device. 

**Trustless and Decentralized SSO**

Hypersign leverages full fledged SSO feature from an open source software - *KeyCloak* - in order to provide a complete solution for Identity Management and Access Management. As mentioned earlier, Hypersign does not uses username and password, rather uses public key cryptography for access where users have complete control of their private key which never leaves their mobile device whatsoever. The protocol validates the digital signature, produced by ECDSA algorithm in mobile device (**HS-Mobile App**), on **HS-Auth Service** which is nothing but a smart contract deployed on Ethereum Blockchain and not relying on central authority for signature verification and hence providing a complete  trust less and decentralized environment for SSO.

## Usecases

- Online Media Streaming (eliminate password Sharing)
- Banking (username/password dependency)
- Blockchain (Signing Transaction using custom provider)
- SSO (Single Sign On for DApps and WebApps)

**USP**

The protocol is developed keeping all kind of businesses in mind and is highly configurable. It gets easily integrated with all types of applications, be it is Mobile App or Web App or DApp.
